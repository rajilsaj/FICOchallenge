## FICO Educational Challenge 2026

This repository contains the work for the **FICO Educational Challenge 2026**, focused on building a machine learning system for **intent classification in customer collections conversations** using **synthetic data**.

The project follows an end-to-end ML lifecycle: data generation, model training and evaluation, and final implementation and optimization.

###  Project Overview

Banks and lenders interact with customers across digital channels (SMS, chat, email, etc.) to resolve past-due accounts.  
The goal of this project is to accurately and efficiently classify customer **intent** (e.g., `PAY_NOW`, `REQUEST_EXTENSION`, `SPEAK_TO_AGENT`) in a **high-risk financial context**, where accuracy and latency are critical.

The solution is evaluated on:
- **Accuracy** of intent classification  
- **Latency** (speed of processing conversations)  
- **Presentation quality**

###  Project Workstreams

The project is organized into three core workstreams:

1. **Data Manipulation & Synthetic Data Generation**  
   - Generate realistic synthetic conversation data  
   - Clean, preprocess, and analyze datasets  

2. **Model Training, Evaluation & Alternative Approaches**  
   - Train baseline and advanced ML / LLM-based models  
   - Evaluate and compare performance  

3. **Implementation, Testing & Fine-Tuning**  
   - Build end-to-end pipelines  
   - Fine-tune models and optimize inference
