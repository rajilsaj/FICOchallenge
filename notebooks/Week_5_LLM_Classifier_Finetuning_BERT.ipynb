        "\n",
        "\"BERT base model (uncased)\" is a pre-trained language model from Google’s BERT family with 110M parameters, and lowercased tokenization.\n",
        "\n",
        "- BERT stands for **Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers**\n",
        "- It uses bi-directional approach and can understand the context of words in a sentence by considering both the left and right context of each word\n",
        "- It is Encoder only architecture - Focuses on understanding input sequences rather than generating output sequences\n",
        "- It is pre-trained on large corpus of unlabeled English data from BookCorpus and English Wikipedia to learn contextual embeddings\n",
        "- The model is widely used for tasks like text classification and question answering\n",

Can you tell me a little bit about what's going on?\\n\\nUser: whass good, i got laid off a lil while back cuz my old job was goin through some restructuring. but i just got hired at a new place with a way better salary, so i'm tryin to get my finances back on track.\\n\\nBot: Congratulations on your new job! We're glad to hear that you're doing better. We understand that temporary layoffs can be tough. Can you tell me a bit more about your current financial situation and how you plan to pay off the past-due balance?\\n\\nUser: yeah, i'm doin way better now, but i'm still tryin to get stable. i was thinkin maybe i could set up a payment plan to pay off the balance in smaller chunks. i got a savings account linked to my credit card, and i think i can use that to make the payments without too much strain on my credit score.\\n\\nBot: That sounds like a great idea! We can definitely work with you to set up a payment plan that fits your needs. Can you tell me how often you'd like to make the payments and how much you think you can afford to pay each time?\\n\\nUser: hmm, how about biweekly? that way i can spread it out a bit more. and i think i can do like 200-250 per payment, depending on how my expenses go for the month.\\n\\nBot: Biweekly payments and a payment amount of $200-250 per payment sounds like a good plan. I'll go ahead and set that up for you. We'll also make sure to report the payments to the credit bureaus so that your credit score is updated accordingly. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss or any questions you have about the payment plan?\",\n          \"\\n\\nBot: Hello, this is a representative from [Bank Name]. We're reaching out to discuss your recent mortgage payment that was due on December 1st. Can you tell me a little bit about what's going on?\\n\\nUser: Good morning. Thank you for contacting me. I appreciate your promptness. I'd like to explain the situation. I've recently undergone a change in my financial situation due to a divorce settlement. As a result, my income has been reduced significantly.\\n\\nBot: I'm so sorry to hear that, and I appreciate your transparency. Can you tell me a bit more about the settlement and how it's affected your income?\\n\\nUser: Essentially, I was awarded a lump sum payment as part of the settlement, which has been a huge help in covering some of my expenses. However, it's also reduced my monthly income, making it challenging for me to keep up with my mortgage payments.\\n\\nBot: I understand the complexity of the situation. Can you tell me more about your current financial situation, and how you plan to adjust to this new income?\\n\\nUser: I'm currently reviewing my budget and making adjustments to ensure that I can cover all my essential expenses. However, I do need some additional time to get my finances in order. That's why I'm requesting an extension on my mortgage payment due date from January 1st to February 15th.\\n\\nBot: I can see that this would give you some extra time to adjust to your new financial situation. I'd like to discuss the possibility of an extension with our team. Can you confirm that you're expecting a reduction in income for the next few months, and this extension would help you get back on track?\\n\\nUser: Yes, that's correct. I anticipate a temporary reduction in income until I can adjust my budget and find ways to increase my earnings. The extension would be a huge help in getting my finances back on track.\\n\\nBot: I've taken note of your request, and I'll discuss it with our team to see what options are available. I'll be in touch with you shortly to let you know the next steps. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.\\n\\nUser: Thank you for your understanding and assistance. I appreciate your help in navigating this challenging situation.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Pre-trained models converge quickly. More epochs often lead to overfitting, especially with smaller datasets. Monitor validation metrics to determine optimal stopping point. Weight decay helps prevent overfitting. Start low and increase if you see overfitting signs. For each parameter below, try experimenting within the specified ranges I've included in the comment. Try and find the optimal hyperparameter settings that give the best performance on the validation set without overfitting."
