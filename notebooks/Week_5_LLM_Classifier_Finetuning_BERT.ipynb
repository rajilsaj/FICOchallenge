        "\"BERT base model (uncased)\" is a pre-trained language model from Google’s BERT family with 110M parameters, and lowercased tokenization.\n",
        "\n",
        "- BERT stands for **Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers**\n",
        "- It uses bi-directional approach and can understand the context of words in a sentence by considering both the left and right context of each word\n",
        "- It is Encoder only architecture - Focuses on understanding input sequences rather than generating output sequences\n",
        "- It is pre-trained on large corpus of unlabeled English data from BookCorpus and English Wikipedia to learn contextual embeddings\n",
        "- The model is widely used for tasks like text classification and question answering\n",

I'd be happy to help you resolve the issue with your account. However, I'm not sure how I can assist you with the cost of refrigerator repairs.

This is exactly the kind of service I expect from a reputable bank like yours. Can you at least expedite the payment processing so I can get my account up to date sooner?\\n\\nBot: I understand your frustration, Mr. Johnson. I'll do my best to help you resolve the issue with your account as soon as possible. However, I need to clarify that expedited payment processing is not a standard service we offer.

My name is Alex and I'll be happy to assist you with your mortgage account. How are you today?\\n\\nUser: Good morning, Alex. I appreciate your time. I've been trying to reach someone for a while now, but the automated phone system kept disconnecting me. I'm concerned about my past-due mortgage payment and would like to speak with a representative to discuss my options.\\n\\nBot: I apologize for any inconvenience you experienced with our phone system. I'm happy to help you today. Can you please confirm your mortgage account information so I can access your account securely?\\n\\nUser: My account information is up-to-date. I've been paying my mortgage on time until recently when I experienced some unexpected financial difficulties. I'd like to discuss my payment history and explore options for temporary forbearance or a hardship plan to get back on track.\\n\\nBot: I understand your situation, and I'm here to help. Can you tell me a little more about the financial difficulties you're experiencing? This will help me better understand your situation and provide you with the most suitable options.\\n\\nUser: I've had some unexpected medical expenses and a reduction in income due to a company restructuring. As a result, I'm struggling to make ends meet, and my mortgage payment has fallen behind.\\n\\nBot: I appreciate you sharing this information with me. I'm going to review your account and discuss your options with you. Would you like me to explain the temporary forbearance or hardship plan in more detail, or would you prefer to focus on getting your account current as soon as possible?\",\n          \"\\n\\nBot: Hi there, this is [Bank Representative]. We wanted to reach out to you about your credit card account. You've got a past-due balance that we're concerned about. Can you tell me a little bit about what's going on?\\n\\nUser: whass good, i got laid off a lil while back cuz my old job was goin through some restructuring. but i just got hired at a new place with a way better salary, so i'm tryin to get my finances back on track.\\n\\nBot: Congratulations on your new job! We're glad to hear that you're doing better. We understand that temporary layoffs can be tough. Can you tell me a bit more about your current financial situation and how you plan to pay off the past-due balance?\\n\\nUser: yeah, i'm doin way better now, but i'm still tryin to get stable. i was thinkin maybe i could set up a payment plan to pay off the balance in smaller chunks. i got a savings account linked to my credit card, and i think i can use that to make the payments without too much strain on my credit score.\\n\\nBot: That sounds like a great idea! We can definitely work with you to set up a payment plan that fits your needs. Can you tell me how often you'd like to make the payments and how much you think you can afford to pay each time?\\n\\nUser: hmm, how about biweekly? that way i can spread it out a bit more. and i think i can do like 200-250 per payment, depending on how my expenses go for the month.\\n\\nBot: Biweekly payments and a payment amount of $200-250 per payment sounds like a good plan. I'll go ahead and set that up for you. We'll also make sure to report the payments to the credit bureaus so that your credit score is updated accordingly. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss or any questions you have about the payment plan?\",\n          \"\\n\\nBot: Hello, this is a representative from [Bank Name]. We're reaching out to discuss your recent mortgage payment that was due on December 1st. Can you tell me a little bit about what's going on?\\n\\nUser: Good morning. Thank you for contacting me. I appreciate your promptness. I'd like to explain the situation. I've recently undergone a change in my financial situation due to a divorce settlement. As a result, my income has been reduced significantly.\\n\\nBot: I'm so sorry to hear that, and I appreciate your transparency. Can you tell me a bit more about the settlement and how it's affected your income?\\n\\nUser: Essentially, I was awarded a lump sum payment as part of the settlement, which has been a huge help in covering some of my expenses. However, it's also reduced my monthly income, making it challenging for me to keep up with my mortgage payments.\\n\\nBot: I understand the complexity of the situation. Can you tell me more about your current financial situation, and how you plan to adjust to this new income?\\n\\nUser: I'm currently reviewing my budget and making adjustments to ensure that I can cover all my essential expenses. However, I do need some additional time to get my finances in order. That's why I'm requesting an extension on my mortgage payment due date from January 1st to February 15th.\\n\\nBot: I can see that this would give you some extra time to adjust to your new financial situation. I'd like to discuss the possibility of an extension with our team. Can you confirm that you're expecting a reduction in income for the next few months, and this extension would help you get back on track?\\n\\nUser: Yes, that's correct. I anticipate a temporary reduction in income until I can adjust my budget and find ways to increase my earnings. The extension would be a huge help in getting my finances back on track.\\n\\nBot: I've taken note of your request, and I'll discuss it with our team to see what options are available. I'll be in touch with you shortly to let you know the next steps. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.\\n\\nUser: Thank you for your understanding and assistance.

Can you please confirm your account name and the last four digits of your account number so I can access your information?\\n\\nUser: My name is associated with account number ending in 9012. I'd like to pay the full amount of $2,356.90 due today.\\n\\nBot: Thank you for providing that information, and I'm glad you're looking to settle your balance today. To confirm, you'd like to make a payment of $2,356.90 from your savings account associated with that account number?\\n\\nUser: Yes, that's correct. I'd like to use my linked savings account to cover the full amount.\\n\\nBot: Great, I've taken note of that. I just need to verify the account you'd like to use for the payment. Can you confirm the account type and routing number for the savings account you'd like to use?\\n\\nUser: My savings account is a [Bank Name] account with the standard routing number for [Bank Name]. I've linked it to my account with you.\\n\\nBot: Thank you for confirming the account information. I've processed the payment, and your account should be updated within the next few business days. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?\",\n          \"\\n\\nBot: Hi there, this is an important message from Bank. We're reaching out about your home equity loan, which is currently past due. Can you please confirm your name and account information so we can discuss further?\\n\\nUser: Seriously? Can't you see I'm busy? Fine. My name is John and I'm the primary account holder. But I don't appreciate the timing of this message. My payment is due on June 1st, right?\\n\\nBot: I apologize for any inconvenience, John. I understand that this is a busy time. We're reaching out because we want to work with you to find a solution that works for everyone. Can you tell me a bit more about what's going on with your account? You're right that the due date is June 1st.\\n\\nUser: Look, my business is seasonal, okay? We're slow this time of year and I'm not getting the same income. I'm barely scraping by. That's why my payment is late. But I'm not trying to avoid paying you. I just need a little more time to get back on my feet. Can't you just move the due date to July 15th or something? That would really help me out.\\n\\nBot: I understand that this is a challenging time for your business, John. We want to help you succeed. Let's see what we can do. Can you confirm that July 15th is a date that works for you? We can definitely work with you to move the due date.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Pre-trained models converge quickly. More epochs often lead to overfitting, especially with smaller datasets. Monitor validation metrics to determine optimal stopping point. Weight decay helps prevent overfitting. Start low and increase if you see overfitting signs. For each parameter below, try experimenting within the specified ranges I've included in the comment. Try and find the optimal hyperparameter settings that give the best performance on the validation set without overfitting."
